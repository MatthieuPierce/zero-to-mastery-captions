Hey everybody.

00:02.130 --> 00:09.210
We have our robofriends app now on github and you should be able to put up your robofriends project

00:09.240 --> 00:12.130
on GitHub but here's the thing.

00:12.150 --> 00:18.930
Wouldn't it be nice if we can use GitHub pages to actually check out our robofriends app without having

00:18.930 --> 00:28.940
us to clone download npm install just like we've done with simple HTML projects? Well with the

00:28.940 --> 00:29.690
create-react-app,

00:29.690 --> 00:35.310
there's actually a way to do this using GitHub pages.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.490
Now I'll link to this resource so that you can follow step by step.

00:39.490 --> 00:43.010
But let's just go through it and see how easy it is.

00:43.030 --> 00:46.460
I have the project right here.

00:46.510 --> 00:50.450
It says that I need to add a homepage to package.json.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.400
So let's do that.

00:51.400 --> 00:59.330
I'm going to copy this and added in our package.json does it matter where it is.

00:59.330 --> 01:05.090
Let's how to write after the name make this a little bit bigger.

01:05.160 --> 01:12.190
I'm going to add my username here and this is the repository name in our case.

01:12.210 --> 01:14.150
What was it?

01:14.210 --> 01:15.620
It was robofriends.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.750
So again use your GitHub username.

01:18.290 --> 01:24.370
And then in here add your GitHub project name next.

01:25.490 --> 01:34.630
If we go through the steps it says that I need to install GitHub pages (gh-pages) this package and then add it to

01:34.630 --> 01:35.970
my deploy script.

01:36.010 --> 01:42.590
So let's just copy and paste this so if you're using NPM you can do that if you're using yarn,

01:42.590 --> 01:43.520
this is the command.

01:44.510 --> 01:47.390
So let's install GitHub pages (gh-pages)

01:50.290 --> 01:56.260
and while that's getting installed let's go back here and it shows here that we need to add these two

01:56.260 --> 02:01.240
lines: a predeploy and deploy in our scripts.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.220
So once again go to our scripts

02:06.390 --> 02:08.900
and then copy and paste this line.

02:09.180 --> 02:13.860
So we have the predeploy and the deploy.

02:13.860 --> 02:18.600
So the pre deploy runs 'npm run build' which we know what that does.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.710
It builds our project.

02:20.870 --> 02:25.490
It creates a production version of our project and creates a build folder.

02:25.490 --> 02:33.140
And then the deploy is going to use this GitHub pages so that we just installed and use our build folder.

02:33.140 --> 02:35.560
Let's go back.

02:35.660 --> 02:35.990
All right.

02:35.990 --> 02:40.780
And then finally we had to deploy this site by running 'npm run deploy'.

02:41.720 --> 02:42.590
So let's do that.

02:42.590 --> 02:50.190
Let me save and then and here do let's clear this.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.010
Do 'npm run deploy'

02:55.240 --> 02:56.470
which is this script.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.580
And remember the predeploy's going to be run before it.

02:59.710 --> 03:04.900
So if I run this it looks like I have an error in my JSON package.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.130
Let's see.

03:06.130 --> 03:07.520
What am I missing here.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.570
Well I have a comma at the end here which I don't need.

03:10.570 --> 03:15.720
Let's run that again.

03:15.750 --> 03:18.880
You see that the build folder was just created.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.360
It's creating an optimized production build.

03:21.600 --> 03:28.370
That's great; and there we have it: our project is now published.

03:28.370 --> 03:38.910
Now all we have to do is go back to our repository go to settings and if we scroll all the way down

03:39.120 --> 03:47.670
to GitHub Pages we have to change the source to GitHub Pages branch (gh-pages branch).

03:47.680 --> 03:53.620
Now you might have to wait a couple of minutes or even refresh the page to make sure that the changes

03:53.620 --> 03:55.010
have been applied.

03:55.300 --> 04:03.740
And if all goes well remember we're selecting the github pages branch and I click on this link and I

04:03.740 --> 04:04.820
refresh.

04:04.820 --> 04:05.840
There you go.

04:05.840 --> 04:16.950
Our robo friends app is now live at this URL so I can just copy this your URL go to my project click

04:17.760 --> 04:26.200
edit and then add our Web site right here so next time anybody comes and checks out our repository they

04:26.200 --> 04:29.470
can just click here to see the live project.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.980
How cool is that.

04:31.060 --> 04:39.600
Nice and simple and just like that we have a production ready app because remember create react app

04:39.960 --> 04:46.690
for us optimizes everything and keeps everything really really tiny for production.

04:46.710 --> 04:54.090
Our JavaScript files while they're minimized they look very small and well, nothing like we had before

04:54.150 --> 05:03.870
with containers and components all of that because we used create react app gets optimized for production

05:05.410 --> 05:09.910
congratulations, go show off to your friends, I'll see you in the next one, byebye.
